# Take back your time; Let AI do the work for you!

We all have those tasks that keep coming back, taking away from the tasks we really would want to be doing. Maybe it's writing your hours in different systems for your clients, claiming back your expenses, or typing data from a form into that legacy system. We can't change the underlying systems, so we are just stuck with this manual effort time and time again... Or are we?

What if we could automate these tasks, without the need to change our applications? In this session full of demos you will learn how to use UI Flows to set up your personal RPA helpers, that will take these repeating actions out of your hands. And we will make your flows even smarter, by using the power of Microsoft Cognitive Services to recognize text and images. Together these services allow us to automate all those tedious repeating chores, allowing us to focus on our interesting tasks. And all this using an intuitive UI, without the need to write any code.
